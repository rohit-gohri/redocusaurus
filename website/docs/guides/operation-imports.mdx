# ApiOperation

You can import operation definitions from your API schema and render them in your Docusaurus Docs.

:::info File format
You cannot import a React component inside a `.md` file.  
Change your file extension to `.mdx` before importing the React Component.  
Read more [here about MDX in Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/react).
:::

## Import

```tsx
import ApiOperation from '@theme/ApiOperation';
```

## Examples

### Basic example

The `pointer` prop is passed on to [Redoc](https://redoc.ly/docs/resources/ref-guide/#pointer). Note that `/` is escaped as `~1`.

```tsx
<ApiOperation pointer="#/paths/~1pet/post" />
```

#### Results

<ApiOperation pointer="#/paths/~1pet/post" />

### Display with "examples"

```tsx
import ApiOperation from '@theme/ApiOperation';

<ApiOperation example pointer="#/paths/~1pet/post" />;
```

#### Results

<ApiOperation example pointer="#/paths/~1pet/post" />

### Multiple OpenAPI schemas

If you have multiple APIs loaded with redocusaurus, then it is recommended to add `id`s to the config so that you can refer them when loading operation models.

```js title="docusaurus.config.js"
const config = {
  presets: [
    '@docusaurus/preset-classic',
    [
      'redocusaurus',
      {
        specs: [
          {
            id: 'using-single-yaml',
            spec: 'openapi/single-file/openapi.yaml',
            route: '/examples/using-single-yaml/',
          },
          {
            id: 'using-remote-url',
            spec: 'https://redocly.github.io/redoc/openapi.yaml',
            route: '/examples/using-remote-url/',
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  ],
  title: 'Redocusaurus',
};
```

```tsx
import ApiOperation from '@theme/ApiOperation';

<ApiOperation id="using-single-yaml" pointer="#/paths/~1pet/post" />
<ApiOperation id="using-remote-url" pointer="#/paths/~1pet/post" />
```

#### Results for ID `id="using-single-yaml"`

<ApiOperation id="using-single-yaml" pointer="#/paths/~1pet/post" />

#### Results for ID `id="using-remote-url"`

<ApiOperation id="using-remote-url" pointer="#/paths/~1pet/post" />

### Pass JSON Spec Directly

You can also provide a JSON spec to the component like this. Docusaurus will load the file directly during build time, but the file will not undergo any pre-processing at build time and so some features might be missing.

```tsx
import ApiOperation from '@theme/ApiOperation';
import openApi from './api-with-examples.json';

<ApiOperation spec={openApi} pointer="#/paths/~1pet/post" />;
```

<ApiOperation spec={openApi} pointer="#/paths/~1pet/post" />;

:::info YAML support
You cannot load yaml file like this:

```tsx
import openApi from './api-with-examples.yaml';
```

Without the right webpack configuration to handle such file format.
