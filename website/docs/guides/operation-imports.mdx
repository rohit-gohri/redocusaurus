# ApiOperation

You can import operation definitions from your API schema and render them in your Docusaurus Docs.

:::info File format
You cannot import a React component inside a `.md` file.  
Change your file extension to `.mdx` before importing the React Component.  
Read more [here about MDX in Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/react).

# Import Operation Model in Docs

The `pointer` prop is passed on to [Redoc](https://redoc.ly/docs/resources/ref-guide/#pointer).

Note that `/` is escaped as `~1`.

```tsx
import ApiOperation from '@theme/ApiOperation';

<ApiOperation pointer="#/paths/~1pet/post" />;
```

### Results

<ApiOperation pointer="#/paths/~1pet/post" />

## Import Operation Model (with example) in Docs

```tsx
import ApiOperation from '@theme/ApiOperation';

<ApiOperation example pointer="#/paths/~1pet/post" />;
```

### Results

<ApiOperation example pointer="#/paths/~1pet/post" />

## Importing Operation Model with multiple OpenAPI schemas

If you have multiple APIs loaded with redocusaurus, then it is recommended to add `id`s to the config so that you can refer them when loading operation models.

```js title="docusaurus.config.js"
const config = {
  presets: [
    '@docusaurus/preset-classic',
    [
      'redocusaurus',
      {
        specs: [
          {
            id: 'using-single-yaml',
            spec: 'openapi/single-file/openapi.yaml',
            route: '/examples/using-single-yaml/',
          },
          {
            id: 'using-remote-url',
            spec: 'https://redocly.github.io/redoc/openapi.yaml',
            route: '/examples/using-remote-url/',
          },
        ],
        theme: {
          /**
           * Highlight color for docs
           */
          primaryColor: '#1890ff',
          /**
           * Options to pass to redoc
           * @see https://github.com/redocly/redoc#redoc-options-object
           */
          options: { disableSearch: true },
        },
      },
    ],
  ],
  title: 'Redocusaurus',
};
```

```tsx
import ApiOperation from '@theme/ApiOperation';

<ApiOperation id="using-single-yaml" pointer="#/paths/~1pet/post" />
<ApiOperation id="using-remote-url" pointer="#/paths/~1pet/post" />
```

### Results

#### For ID `id="using-single-yaml"`

<ApiOperation id="using-single-yaml" pointer="#/paths/~1pet/post" />

#### For ID `id="using-remote-url"`

<ApiOperation id="using-remote-url" pointer="#/paths/~1pet/post" />
