# Component Usage

You can also display the whole OpenAPI documentation using a React component to do custom layouts like [Nested views](/docs/guides/multiple-apis) or to manually pass API files.

:::info File format
You cannot import a React component inside a `.md` file.  
Change your file extension to `.mdx` before importing the React Component.  
Read more [here about MDX in Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/react).
:::

## Import

```tsx
import Redoc from '@theme/Redoc';
```

## Examples

### Basic example

It displays here the first element of the redocusaurus configuration.

```tsx
import Redoc from '@theme/Redoc';

<Redoc />;
```

### External URL example

```tsx
import Redoc from '@theme/Redoc';

<Redoc url="https://redocly.github.io/redoc/openapi.yaml" />;
```

### Specific id example

The id is used to look for the OpenAPI spec defined in `docusaurus.config`.

```tsx
import Redoc from '@theme/Redoc';

<Redoc id="using-single-yaml" />;
```

### Pass JSON Spec Directly

You can also provide a JSON spec to the component like this. Docusaurus will load the file directly during build time, but the file will not undergo any pre-processing at build time and so some features might be missing.

```tsx
import Redoc from '@theme/Redoc';
import openApi from './api-with-examples.json';

<Redoc spec={openApi} />;
```

:::info YAML support
You cannot load yaml file like this:

```tsx
import openApi from './api-with-examples.yaml';
```

Without the right Docusaurus configuration to handle such file format.

### Results

<Redoc spec={openApi} />
