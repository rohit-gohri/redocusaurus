## Prerequisites

To enable SSR you have to do 2 things:

### Updating your Root theme component

Use the custom ServerStyle component in your [Theme Root](https://docusaurus.io/docs/using-themes#wrapper-your-site-with-root) (as mentioned [here](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/3236#issuecomment-788953743)) for SSR like below:

```tsx title="src/theme/Root/index.tsx"
import React from 'react';

import ServerStyle from '@theme/ServerStyle';

function Root({ children }: { children: React.Component }): JSX.Element {
  return (
    <>
      // TODO: Remove when docusaurus adds proper css-in-js support
      <ServerStyle from={children} />
      {children}
    </>
  );
}

export default Root;
```

### Use yaml files rather than urls to load OpenAPI files

To enable SSR we need to parse the schema at build time so it needs to passed on as a yaml and it will be processed to JSON. This has a side-effect of the download button pointing to the JSON, to fix this you can also provide a `specUrl` to the original url that will be used as the download link.

```js title="docusaurs.config.js"
const config = {
  presets: [
    [
      'redocusaurus',
      {
        specs: [
          {
            spec: 'openapi.yaml',
            /**
             * This becomes the Download URL in this case, while docs are generated from `spec`
             */
            specUrl: `${process.env.DEPLOY_BASE_URL || '/'}openapi-page.yaml`,
            routePath: '/examples/using-spec-yaml/',
          },
        ],
        theme: {
          /**
           * Highlight color for docs
           */
          primaryColor: '#1890ff',
          /**
           * Options to pass to redoc
           * @see https://github.com/redocly/redoc#redoc-options-object
           */
          redocOptions: { hideDownloadButton: false, disableSearch: true },
        },
      },
    ],
    '@docusaurus/preset-classic',
  ],
  title: 'Redocusaurus',
};
```
