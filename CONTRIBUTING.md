# Contributing

## Setup

See [DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md)

## Pull Requests

Each pull request should also have a [`changeset`](./.changeset/README.md) in it for the build to pass.

### Automated Checks

On every PR some automated checks run as part of the CI/CD pipelines, these should be passing before a PR can be merged.

## Documentation

The [documentation](./website/docs) is setup as a Docusaurus project itself. You can edit the markdown files to edit the corresponding page or create a new markdown file to add a new page.
